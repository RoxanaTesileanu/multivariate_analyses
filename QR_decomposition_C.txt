The QR-decomposition of a correlation matrix C

Notations:
C - correlation matrix
U - a p by p matrix with orthonormal columns (the columns are eigenvectors)
U' - a transpose of U
R - an invertible p by p upper triangular matrix
L - a matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal

The correlation matrix C can be decomposed in: 
C = UR 

From Theorem 2 (p. 289 Paul's Notes): 
U'U = I (I of dimension p)

Now we can write that:

Cx = URx=b (where b is a column vector)

From Theorem 3 (p. 291 Paul's Notes):
Rx = U'b

So, we can write:
Cx = UU'b
Because UU'=I, we can further write:
Cx = Ib
Now from Quinn and Keogth (2002) we know:
Ib = L, so that Cx = L (where x is the eigenvector of C associated with L)
