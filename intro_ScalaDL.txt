ch.1 Getting started

ML problems are categorized as classifications, prediction, optimization and regression.
Classification - example: identify a disease from a set of symptoms
Prediction - once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to predict some outcomes (a doctor collects symptoms and anticipates the health state).
Optimization - ML techniques increase the chances that the optimization method converges towards a solution (intelligent search) (example: fighting the spread of a new virus requires optimizing a process that may evolve over time as more symptoms and cases are uncovered).
Regression: is a classification technique particularly suitable for a continuous model.

Why Scala? 
- abstraction: monads (derived from the category and group theory to create high-level abstractions); covariant, contravariant functors and bifunctors (related to manifold and vector bundles used in non-linear model building).    

- higher-kind projection: classification problems rely on the estimation of the similarity between vectors of observations. One technique consists in comparing two vectors by computing the normalized inner product. A co-vector alpha is defined as a linear map of a vector to the inner product. 

- covariant functors for vectors: F[U => V] := F[U] => F[V]
- contravariant functors for co-vector: F[U => V] := F[V] => F[U]
- monads: extend the concept of a functor to allow the composition known as the monadic composition of morphisms on a single type.

- scalability: parallelization and chaining of data processing functions using higher-order methods. So one can build scalable, distributed and concurrent applications (using Akka or Apache Spark). 

Model categorization
A model can be predictive, descriptive or adaptive.

- predictive models: discover patterns in the data and extract fundamental trends and relationships between factors (or features). They are used to predict and classify future events or observations. Predictive models are created through supervised learning using a training set.

- descriptive models: attempt to find unusual patterns or affinities in data by grouping observations into clusters with similar properties. They are generated through unsupervised learning.

- adaptive models: created through reinforcement learning (one or more decision-making agents that recommend and possibly execute actions in the attempt of solving a problem, optimizing an objective function, or resolving constraints.

Taxonomy of machine learning algorithms

data mining -> identifying patterns
machine learning -> indentifying and validating models to optimize a performance criterion using data.

A) Unsupervised learning
The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover patterns of regularities and irregularities in a set of observations. There are two categories: discovery of data clusters and discovery of latent factors.
Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data and therefore is easy to implement and execute because no expertise is needed to validate an output.
