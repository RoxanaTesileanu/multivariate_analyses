The MANOVA-KNN pipeline for reducing error in KNN classification tasks


Paper aims: 

Develop the theoretical basis for the MANOVA-KNN pipeline (without Scala implementation, which will follow afterwards). 

The nature-inspired pipeline (inspired from diffusion processes in soils) will combine MANOVA with an adaptive KNN classifier. 

The KNN algorithm will be adaptive by means of a gradient k-improvement optimization of the neighborhood size and direction.
