ch. 18 Multidimensional scaling 

1. Classical scaling - principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)

The matrix of transformed dissimilarities between objects is decomposed through spectral decomposition. We obtain the eigenvectors, scale them by eigenvalues and use the coefficients to plot the objects on the scaling plot.


You can use any dissimilarity measure you consider appropriate for your investigation.

2. Enhanced multidimensional scaling

Improves the fit between dissimilarities and inter-object distances by means of iterative algorithm. 
You can show the relationship between inter-object distance and dissimilarity for all pairs of objects in a Shepard diagram (a scatterplot with dissimilarity on the horizontal axis and inter-object distance on the vertical axis).
