ch. 16 Multivariate Analysis of variance and discriminant analysis

- examine the relationship between two or more response variables and one or more categorical predictor variables.

1. MANOVA

- we record more than one response variable from each sampling or experimental unit and these units are allocated to or occur in treatment groups
- example: we record abundances of many species or measure more than one physiological variables on objects that occur or are allocated to different experimental treatments. For example we have three predator treatments and measure body mass, egg mass, percentage of eggs, total mass and maturation time on mayfly. 

- basically, our hypothesis is now about group effects ON A COMBINATION OF THE RESPONSE VARIABLES and we compare group centroids for two or more variables.

Single factor MANOVA

The MANOVA is based on the linear combination z of p response variables. This linear combination maximizes the ratio of between-group and within-group variances of z using matrix algebra. This linear combination is also called the discriminant function for the difference between groups and is used in discriminant function analysis. 
Now, the process of determining the linear combination includes three SSCP matrices: 
- one matrix for between groups (the effect matrix H)
- one matrix for within groups (the error or residual matrix E)
- one matrix for total (the total matrix T).

Next we multiply H with the inverse of E, i.e. HE^-1 (we actually "divide" H by E).
We then decompose the resulting matrix to calculate characteristic roots (eigenvalues) of each linear combination (eigenvector).
The linear combination producing the largest eigenvalue is the linear combination that maximizes the ratio of between-group and within-group variance and the eigenvector is a vector of coefficients or weights for that linear combination. 

Afterwards we go through the usual statistical procedures: testing the null hypothesis, interpreting results, etc. 
MANOVA can also be used to investigate more complex designs. The basic ideas remain the same.

One of the commonest applications of MANOVA in biology is in the ANALYSIS OF REPEATED MEASURES DESIGNS, where the differences between pairs of repeated measurements are analysed as multiple response variables using MANOVA statistics.

2. Discriminant function analysis

DFA is a classification technique. It can be used to classify new observations into one of the pre-defined groups.
Mathematically DFA is identical to single factor MANOVA. 
Most uses of DFA in biology have focued on description and hypothesis testing rather than classification.
