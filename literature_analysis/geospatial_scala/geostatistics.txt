Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION

- the environment is continuous, but in general we can afford to measure properties at only a finite number of places
-> the best we can do is to estimate, or predict, in a spatial sense.
-> this is the reason we use geostatistics; it allows us to deal with properties that vary in ways that are far from systematic and at all spatial scales. 

GEOSTATISTICS CAN NEVER PROVIDE COMPLETE INFORMATION, BUT, GIVEN THE DATA, IT CAN ENABLE YOU TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITIES THAT THE TRUE DATA ARE WITHIN SOME SPECIFIED BOUNDS. 
__________________________________________

Generalizing:  
The environment extends more or less continuously in two dimensions. It varies from place to place beeing marked by complex interrelated processes (panarchy of processes at fast to slow paces and from small to large scales). 
Obvious properties can be analysed from aerial photos or satellite imagery, others like soil properties cannot. For the later ones we rely on measurements and analysis of samples.

BY DESCRIBING THE VARIATION AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS WE CAN OFTEN GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESSES AND FACTORS THAT CAUSE OR CONTROL IT, AND SO PREDICT IN A SPATIAL SENSE AND MANAGE RESOURCES.

An additional issue in geospatial analysis is that AT SOME SCALE THE VALUES OF PROPERTIES ARE AUTOCORRELATED.
Places close to one another tend to have similar values, whereas ones that are farther apart differ more on average. We have to QUANTIFY THE SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION AT THE SCALE OF INTEREST! 

Reasons for geostatistics: description, explanation and control.

Description:
- classical surveys: data are summarized by means, medians, modes, variances, skewness, cummulative frequency distribution and histograms, box-plots. 
- geostatistical surveys: similarly + SPATIAL CORRELATION
This is represented by the EXPERIMENTAL OR SAMPLE VARIOGRAM. 
In a variogram the variance is estimated at increasing intervals of distance and several directions. Alternatively, it may be the corresponding set of spatial covariances or autocorrelation coefficients. 
In addition, we should plot the sampling points on a map ("posting"). This will show the extent to which the sample fills the region of interest, any clustering, and any obvious mistakes in recording the positions such as reversed coordinates. 

Interpretation:
- we draw the variogram, we fit the model. 
- we interpret them. Show how the properties change with distance (variograms for different directions). 
- interpret in a spatial sense.   

Control:
- the idea of controlling a process is often central in time-series analyses (also plagued by autocorrelation - temporal autocorrelation this time). 
- the results of the analysis are used to change the process itself (classic control) or decisions (where you cannot control the process as soil properties cannot be altered, they are given).

History of geostatistics:
- roots in mining, petroleum extraction, agronomy and forestry. 
Nowadays we find it in many fields from petroleun engineering, hydrogeology, meteorology, soil science, agriculture, pollution, fisheries to environmental protection.

Chapter 2: BASIC STATISTICS

- basic quantitative methods for obtaining and summarizing information on the environment: the choice of variables and how to sample the environment.

- how these records can be used for estimation, prediction and mapping.
- in general  numerical variables and categorical variables (called "indicators" in geostat.)

ANOTHER FEATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DATA IS THAT THEY HAVE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COMPONENTS AS WELL AS RECORDED VALUES !
-> we distinguish MEASUREMENT, LOCATION and TIME. 

On the notation:
-x = {x1, x2} is a vector of the two spatial coordiantes
- Z(x) , bold x, means a random variable Z at place x,
- z(x) is the actual value of Z at place x.
- Greek letters for parameter notation and their ^ ("hat" versions) for their estimates.
  
   
Spatial aspects: 
- check how the variables behave at least in the directions of the axes of the coordinate system 
-> express spatial variation 
- use stratified sampling and see how the within-stratum variance is compared to the total variance.IF THERE IS SPATIAL DEPENDENCE -> WITHIN-STRATUM VARIANCE IS LESS THAN THAT OF A SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLE FOR THE SAME EFFORT! (see more on p. 33). 
- use systematic sampling - for a more even cover use two-dimensional grids.
The problem is that we eliminate randomization, once we chose a starting point. So, the whole discussion on variance and standard error using tables falls out of discussion. An approximation may be obtained by dividing the region into strata and computing the pooled within-stratum variance as if sampling were random within the strata.
