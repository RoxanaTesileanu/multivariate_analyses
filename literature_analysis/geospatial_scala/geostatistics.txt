- the environment is continuous, but in general we can afford to measure properties at only a finite number of places
-> the best we can do is to estimate, or predict, in a spatial sense.
-> this is the reason we use geostatistics; it allows us to deal with properties that vary in ways that are far from systematic and at all spatial scales. 

GEOSTATISTICS CAN NEVER PROVIDE COMPLETE INFORMATION, BUT, GIVEN THE DATA, IT CAN ENABLE YOU TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITIES THAT THE ESTIMATED DATA ARE WITHIN SOME SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS.
