- the environment is continuous, but in general we can afford to measure properties at only a finite number of places
-> the best we can do is to estimate, or predict, in a spatial sense.
-> this is the reason we use geostatistics; it allows us to deal with properties that vary in ways that are far from systematic and at all spatial scales. 

GEOSTATISTICS CAN NEVER PROVIDE COMPLETE INFORMATION, BUT, GIVEN THE DATA, IT CAN ENABLE YOU TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITIES THAT THE TRUE DATA ARE WITHIN SOME SPECIFIED BOUNDS. 
__________________________________________

Generalizing:  
The environment extends more or less continuously in two dimensions. It varies from place to place beeing marked by complex interrelated processes (panarchy of processes at fast to slow paces and from small to large scales). 
Obvious properties can be analysed from aerial photos or satellite imagery, others like soil properties cannot. For the later ones we rely on measurements and analysis of samples.

BY DESCRIBING THE VARIATION AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS WE CAN OFTEN GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESSES AND FACTORS THAT CAUSE OR CONTROL IT, AND SO PREDICT IN A SPATIAL SENSE AND MANAGE RESOURCES.
