Using LAPACK

From the Maven repository get the coordinates for the LAPACK package:

// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.fommil.netlib/core
"com.github.fommil.netlib" % "core" % "1.1.2"

Next, add the Maven coordinates to the build.sbt file of the Scala project.

My first problem I need to solve is how I can turn a Scala 2D Array into a Fortran matrix which I can decompose with LAPACK?!
