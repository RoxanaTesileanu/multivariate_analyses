Using LAPACK

From the Maven repository get the coordinates for the LAPACK package:

// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.fommil.netlib/core
"com.github.fommil.netlib" % "core" % "1.1.2"

Next, add the Maven coordinates to the build.sbt file of the Scala project.

My first research questions I need to deal with are:
- how can I turn a Scala 2D Array into a Fortran matrix which I can decompose with LAPACK?
- is the netlib core-1.1.2.jar as easy to use in Scala as the GDAL.jar? 
(i.e. how exactly can I access its functions?)

________________________________________   

Suppose I have the matrix A which is a Scala 2D Array, a vector x of unknowns, and a vector b of constants (entries for the response variable):

val A = Array(Array(3,1,0), Array(-1, 2, 2), Array(5, 0, -1))
val b = Array(6, -7, 10)
import com.github.fommil.netlib.LAPACK.{getInstance => lapack}
lapack.dgesv(....??.....)
