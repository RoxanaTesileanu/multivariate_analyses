Checking BLAS library

As indicated on prof. Wilkinson's research blog, I will try to use BLAS for implementing multivariate techinques.

The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software (from http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html).

Install on Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libatlas-doc
(from https://askubuntu.com/questions/623578/installing-blas-and-lapack-packages)
- Ubuntu doesn't have a binary distribution of either cblas or openblas, but it has ATLAS (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25065113/blas-lapack-not-installed-how-to-install-it)

See the atlas package on Ubuntu at:
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/atlas


---------------------------

Or I should use:
https://commons.apache.org/
Apache Commons
- as indicated by Nicolas.

On my DeepLearning Scala project it is already available for import into Scala. 
Probably because I've icluded Geotrellis in my buid.sbt file.
