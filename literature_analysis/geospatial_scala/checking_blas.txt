Checking BLAS library

As indicated on prof. Wilkinson's research blog, I will try to use BLAS for implementing multivariate techinques.

The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software (from http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html).

Install on Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libatlas-doc
(from https://askubuntu.com/questions/623578/installing-blas-and-lapack-packages)
- Ubuntu doesn't have a binary distribution of either cblas or openblas, but it has ATLAS (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25065113/blas-lapack-not-installed-how-to-install-it)

See the atlas package on Ubuntu at:
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/atlas


---------------------------

I could try to stick to prof. Wilkinson's hint and try out the following import:

scala> import com.github.fommil.netlib.BLAS.{getInstance => blas}
import com.github.fommil.netlib.BLAS.{getInstance=>blas}

Reference:

F2J

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/f2j/
Our primary motivation is to provide numerical linear algebra software originally written in Fortran as Java class files. The numerical libraries will be distributed as class files produced by a Fortran-to-Java translator, f2j. The f2j translator is a formal compiler that translates programs written using a subset of Fortran77 into a form that may be executed on Java virtual machines(JVM). The first priority of f2j is to translate the BLAS and LAPACK numerical libraries from their Fortran77 reference source code to Java class files. We have also used f2j to produce a Java translation of the ARPACK library.

For the buid.sbt file:
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sourceforge.f2j/arpack_combined_all
libraryDependencies += "net.sourceforge.f2j" % "arpack_combined_all" % "0.1"
