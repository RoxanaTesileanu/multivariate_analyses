\section {Introduction}

From Gelman et al. 2014

BAYESIAN INFERENCE is the process of fitting a probability model to a set of data and SUMMARIZING THE RESULT BY A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION ON:
\begin{enumerate}
\item THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL and on
\item THE UNOBSERVED QUANTITIES SUCH AS PREDICTIONS FOR NEW OBSERVATIONS.
\end{enumerate} 
=> make inferences from data using probability models for quantities we observe and for quantities we wish to learn. 
\textbf{THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF BAYESIAN MODELS IS THEIR EXPLICIT USE OF PROBABILITY FOR QUATIFYING UNCERTAINTY IN INFERENCES BASED ON STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSIS}. This is the main idea of the MANOVA-KNN pipeline, to analyse errors and reduce them. I've already sketched a geometric approach. It needs to be better backed up by probability theory. Which is what I expect to find in these Bayesian texts. 
\\
\\ 
Steps of Bayesian Data Analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item setting up A FULL PROBABILITY MODEL - a JOINT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FOR ALL OBSERVABLE AND UNOBSERVABLE QUANTITIES IN A PROBLEM. 
\item CONDITIONING ON OBSERVED DATA - calculating and interpreting the appropriate POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION (which is the conditional probability distribution of the unobserved quantities of ultimate interest, given the observed data). 
\item EVALUATING THE FIT OF THE MODEL AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESULTING POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION: how well does the model fit the data, are the substantive conclusions reasonable, and how sensitive are the results to the modeling assumptions in step 1? \textbf{IN RESPONSE, ONE CAN ALTER OR EXPAND THE MODEL AND REPEAT THE THREE STEPS}.
\end{enumerate}
Advances in carrying the third step alleviate to some degree the need to assume correct model specification at the first attempt. In particular, the much-feared dependence of conclusions on "subjective" prior distributions can be examined and explored.
A primary motivation of Bayesian thinking is that it facilitates a COMMON-SENSE INTERPRETATION OF STATISTICAL CONCLUSIONS. 
Also, the Bayesian paradigm provides a conceptually simple method for \textbf{coping with multiple paramerers}.  

\paragraph{Notation for statistical inference}

\begin{itemize}
\item let $\theta$ denote unobservable vector quantities or POPULATION PARAMETERS OF INTEREST. 
\item $y$ denotes the observed data 
\item $\tilde{y}$ denotes unknown, but potentially observable, quantities 
\end{itemize}
In general these symbols represent MULTIVARIATE QUANTITIES. 
When using matrix notation, we consider vectors as column vectors throughout. 
Data are gathered on each of a set of n objects or units (like in classical multivariante analyses).
 And we can write the data as a vector: $y=(y_1, ..., y_n$).
 If several variables are measured on each unit, then each $y_i$ is a vector. 
\textbf{The entire dataset is a matrix with n rows}. The y variables are called the \textbf{"outcomes" and are considered "random"} in the sense that, when making inferences, we wish to allow for the possibility that the observed values of the variables could have turned out otherwise, due to the sampling process and the natural variation of the population.
 



\section* {Note}
This document is "under construction".
 It contains older notes of mine on Bayesian data analysis.
 Some were used in technical reports of mine (see \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317549069_poisson_model}{https://w\\ww.researchgate.net/publication/317549069\underline{\space}poisson\underline{\space}model}) and also new sections aiming at creating the background necessary for the implementation of the MANOVA-KNN pipeline in geostatistics using the idea of \textbf{posterior predictive checks} (Introduction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis, Andrew Gelman, 2011) \cite{gelman_introduction_2011}.
 For this purpose, I will have to work through books building up my skills, fortunately I was given a hint (and a copy) by a friend on "Bayesian Data Analysis for Social Sciences" by Simon Jackman (Wiley, 2009) \cite{jackman_bayesian_2009} and "Bayesian Data Analysis" by Andrew Gelman, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David B. Dunson, Aki Vehtari and Donald B. Rubin (CRC, 2014) \cite{gelman_bayesian_2014}.
