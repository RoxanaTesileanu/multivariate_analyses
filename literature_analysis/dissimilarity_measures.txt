Dissimilarity measures between objects for continuous variables

1. Euclidean
- the distance between two objects in multidimensional space
- the square root of the sum over all variables, of the square of the difference between the values of each variable for the two objects
- it is 0 for two objects with exaclty the same valures for all variables; otherwise has no upper limit and can be computed even if the objects have no variable in common at all

2. City block or Manhattan 
- the sum (across variables) of the absolute differences in the value of each variable between two objects
- will be dominated by variables with large values 

3. Minkowski
- in addition to Euclidean and City block, this measure normalizes both measures by dividing by the sample size, i.e. the no. of variables that contribute to the disctance measure
- for data sets with different no. of variables !

4. Canberra
- like the City block measure, except that the difference between objects for each variable is divided by the sum of the variable values in the two objects before summing across variables
- to ensure it has an upper limit of 1, we standardize it by the no. of variables that are greater than zero in both objects
- the Canberra measure is less influenced by variables with very large values than the City block measure!

5. Bray-Curtis
- also a modification of City block
- the sum of differences between objects across variables is standardized by the sum of the variable values across objects, also summed across variables
- it ranges between 0 and 1 (0 when both objects completely similar and 1 when completely dissimilar)

6. Chi-square
- is only applicable when the variables are counts!

Dissimilarity measures for dichotomous (binary) variables

a - is the no. of variables with non-zero values in both objects
b - is the no. of variables with non-zero values in object 1
c - is the no. of variables with non-zero values in object 2

Jaccard's coefficient (measure of dissimilarity between two objects with binary variables)
1-(a/(a+b+c))

A slight modification is Sorensen's coeff., which replaces a by 2a.
Sorensen's coeff. is identical to Bray-Curtis measure for binary variables.

Dissimilarity measures for mixed variables

For situations that include A MIXTURE OF CONTINUOUS AND CATEGORICAL VARIABLES.
Gower's coefficient - an "average over all possible similarities"; handles a mixture of variable types by calculating similarity for each variable separately then averaging those similatities.

Comparison of dissimilarity measures

Which of the many dissimilarity measures to use depends on the purpose of the analysis!
Check if the model used requires a dissimilarity measure which is metric.
