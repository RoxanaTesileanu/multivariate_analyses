Comparing distance and/or dissimilarity matrices

- test whether two or more matrices are correlated with each other
- example: compare the matrix of genetic distances between 10 villages to the matrix of geographic distances between the villages.
- example: examine spatial structure when one matrix might be differences in response of experimental units and the other might be the actual physical distances between units
