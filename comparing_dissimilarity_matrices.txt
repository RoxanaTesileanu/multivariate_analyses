Comparing distance and/or dissimilarity matrices

- test whether two or more matrices are correlated with each other
- example: compare the matrix of genetic distances between 10 villages to the matrix of geographic distances between the villages.
- example: examine spatial structure when one matrix might be differences in response of experimental units and the other might be the actual physical distances between units

Mantel's test is used for testing null hypotheses about correlations between matrices. 

Other approaches:
- using the Z statistic in Mantel's test instead of the correlation coefficient. Where Z is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements in the two matrices.
- using the regression coeff. (slope) for elements in one matrix regressed against elements in the other matrix

-example: McCue et al. (1996) correlated the matrix of Cavalli-Svorza genetic distances between the 8 subpopulations of a rare annual plant in California and the matrix of geographic distance between subpopulations.

For more than two matrices we can use an analogue of the coefficient of multiple correlation (r^2) and partial correlations (using the partial Mantel's test).
