R-mode and Q-mode analyses 

A multivariate dataset can be analysed in two ways:
- based on the association between variables: calculates scores for the derived variables (components) for each object, forms LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF VARIABLES => R-mode analysis
- based on the dissimilarity or similarity measures between objects: the dissmilarity indices are calculated for every possible pair of objects; the derived variables are LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF THE OBJECTS => Q-mode analysis

A data matrix of n rows by p variables is converted to:
- a p by p MATRIX OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES (R-mode analyses)

OR

- a n by n MATRIX OF DISSIMILARITIES BETWEEN OBJECTS (Q-mode analyses)


Tips:
Choose the dissimilarity measure that best represents biologically meaningful differences between objects!
