ch 18.2 Classification

One form of classification analysis is the discriminant function analysis where the no. of groups is known a priori.
Another class of classification methods tries to identify the no. of groups from the data. The aim is to group together a no. of objects based on their attributes or variables to produce GROUPS OF OBJECTS where each object within a group is more similar to other objects in that group than to objects in other groups.

1. Cluster analysis

Combines similar objects into groups (clusters), which can be displayed in a dendrogram. 
Probably the most important use of cluster analysis in biology is taxonomic and phylogenetic research, where the dissimilarity measures are often morphological or genetic differences between organisms, species, etc and the dendrogram represents a possible evolutionary sequence.

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering

Most algorithms for agglomerative cluster analysis start with a matrix of pairwise similarities or dissimilarities between the objects and the steps are as follows:
- calculate a matrix of dissimilarities between all pairs of objects
- the first cluster is formed between the two objects with the smallest dissimilarity
- the dissimilarities between this cluster and the remaining objects are them recalculated
- a second cluster is formed between cluster 1 and the object most similar to cluster 1
- the procedure continues until all objects are linked in clusters.

Example: genetic structure of a rare plant
- cluster the subpopulations of a rare annual plant based on Cavalli-Sforza genetic distances between the subpopulations. The pattern is similar to the one obtained from the MDS procedure.
