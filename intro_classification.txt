ch 18.2 Classification

One form of classification analysis is the discriminant function analysis where the no. of groups is known a priori.
Another class of classification methods tries to identify the no. of groups from the data. The aim is to group together a no. of objects based on their attributes or variables to produce GROUPS OF OBJECTS where each object within a group is more similar to other objects in that group than to objects in other groups.

1. Cluster analysis

Combines similar objects into groups (clusters), which can be displayed in a dendrogram. 
Probably the most important use of cluster analysis in biology is taxonomic and phylogenetic research, where the dissimilarity measures are often morphological or genetic differences between organisms, species, etc and the dendrogram represents a possible evolutionary sequence.
