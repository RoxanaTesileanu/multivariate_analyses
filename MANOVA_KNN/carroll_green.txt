Ch.1 - The Nature of Multivariate Data Analysis

Multivariate techniques are useful for:
- discovering regularities in the behavior of two or more variables
- testing alternative models of association between two or more variables, including the determination of whether and how two or more groups (or other entities) differ in their multivariate profiles.

Multivariate analysis is concerned with both the discovery and testing of patterns in associative data.

- characteristics of objects are measured: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED WITH ASSOCIATION AMONG MULTIPLE VARIATES (i.e. variables).

- the process of scientific inquiry: search for naturalistic regularities in phenomena  as well as their incorporation into models for subsequent testing under changed conditions. Multivariate analysis can help the process of discovery (hypothesis creation) as the process of confirmation (hypothesis testing).

- a DATA MATRIX or more DATA MATRICES are the heart of multivariate analyses. 
=> emphasize certain aspects of the association among variables at the expense of supressing less important details.

IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS WE ARE INTERESTED IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIATION IN ONE VARIABLE OR GROUP OF VARIABLES IN TERMS OF COVARIATION WITH OTHER VARIABLES.
=> We analyse associative data: nature and degree of association between a SET OF RESPONSE and a SET OF PREDICTOR variables, finding a function or formula by which we can estimate values of the response variables from values of predictor variables (called the regression problem), stating the statistical confidence.

In some cases we have no prior information for distinguishing between response and predictor variables. We are then interested in their interdependence as a whole.

A classification of techniques for analysing associative data

- according to the data matrix, which is a set of objects (m rows) and a set of measurements on those objects (the n columns). Cell entries represent the value X_ij of object i on variable j. 

- cell values may consist of continuous, discrete and categorical variables or standardized (or their normalized, ranked, ratio-scaled,  etc.  versions) or combinations of these.
