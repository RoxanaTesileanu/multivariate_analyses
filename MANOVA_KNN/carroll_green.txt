Ch.1 - The Nature of Multivariate Data Analysis

Multivariate techniques are useful for:
- discovering regularities in the behavior of two or more variables
- testing alternative models of association between two or more variables, including the determination of whether and how two or more groups (or other entities) differ in their multivariate profiles.

Multivariate analysis is concerned with both the discovery and testing of patterns in associative data.

- characteristics of objects are measured: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED WITH ASSOCIATION AMONG MULTIPLE VARIATES (i.e. variables).

- the process of scientific inquiry: search for naturalistic regularities in phenomena  as well as their incorporation into models for subsequent testing under changed conditions. Multivariate analysis can help the process of discovery (hypothesis creation) as the process of confirmation (hypothesis testing).

- a DATA MATRIX or more DATA MATRICES are the heart of multivariate analyses. 
=> emphasize certain aspects of the association among variables at the expense of supressing less important details.

IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS WE ARE INTERESTED IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIATION IN ONE VARIABLE OR GROUP OF VARIABLES IN TERMS OF COVARIATION WITH OTHER VARIABLES.
=> We analyse associative data: nature and degree of association between a SET OF RESPONSE and a SET OF PREDICTOR variables, finding a function or formula by which we can estimate values of the response variables from values of predictor variables (called the regression problem), stating the statistical confidence.

In some cases we have no prior information for distinguishing between response and predictor variables. We are then interested in their interdependence as a whole.

A classification of techniques for analysing associative data

- the data matrix, which is a set of objects (m rows) and a set of measurements on those objects (the n columns). Cell entries represent the value X_ij of object i on variable j. 

- cell values may consist of continuous, discrete and categorical variables, or, standardized (their normalized, ranked, etc.  versions) or transformed versions, or combinations of these.  

- classifying multivariate techniques according to:
	- purpose of the study and types of assumptions desired by the researcher (e.g. classification, prediction, optimization, regression)
	- whole-dataset vs. datasets for groups (MANOVA vs. cluster analysis)
	- associations among variables vs. associations among objects (PCA vs. PCoA)

	- number of variables in partitioned subsets: 
			- one response variable and more predictor variables (multiple linear regression, multifactor ANOVA)
			- composites of response variables and composites of predictor variables (multifactor MANOVA)
			- composites of response variables and one predictor variable (neural networks)
			- no division in subsets at all (cluster analysis).

If we do partition the dataset we are usually concerned with the LINEAR COMPOSITES OF THE VARIABLES IN THAT SUBSET AND EACH COMPOSITE'S ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER VARIABLES. 
If we choose association of variables, most multivariate analyses assume linear relationships among the variables. A LINEAR MODEL IS OFTEN A GOOD APPROXIMATION TO A NONLINEAR ONE, AT LEAST OVER RANGES OF THE VARIABLES IN QUESTION.

The above classification criteria result in four major subdivisions of interest:

- single response, multiple predictor association: multiple regression analysis, analysis of variance and covariance, and two-group discriminant analysis

- multiple response, multiple predictor association: canonical correlation, multiple  MANOVA and MANCOVA, and multiple discriminant analysis

- analysis of variables interdependence: factor analysis, PCA

- analysis of interobject similarity: cluster analysis and other types of object-grouping procedures.

The first two categories  => dependence structures (response and predictor variables).
The last two categories => interdependence either of variables or objects. 

WITHIN EACH OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, VARIOUS TECHNIQUES ARE DIFFERENTIATED IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF THE VARIABLES!!!


1) Single response, multiple predictor association

- dataset: we have n variables, of which 1 variable is the response variable, the rest of the variables (n-1) are the predictor variables

- this is a prototypical application of MULTIPLE REGRESSION in which one tries to predict values of the response variable from a linear composite (linear combination) of the predictors

- predictors can be either continuous or dummies
- the response variable can be also continuous or could represent the PRIOR CATEGORISATION OF THE RESPONSE VARIABLE based on some classification rule and dummy coded. If our purpose is to develop a linear composite (linear combination) of the predictors that enables us to classify each individual in either category, then we would employ two- (or more) group DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS.

2) Multiple response, multiple predictor association

- more response variables (e.g. consumption of beer, wine and liquor) 
- more predictor variables (e.g. demographic characteristics)
We could develop linear functions of the demographics that would enable us to assign each individual to one of the mutually exclussive groups (which is formed from a combination of the response dummies)  => MULTIPLE DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS 

3) Dimension-reduction methods

- a set of t variables, each of which is expressed as a linear composite of the original n variables
- suppose we want to portray the association across the m individuals in terms of fewer variables than the original n variables. If so, we might employ factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, or some other dimension-reduction method to represent the original set of n correlated variables as linear or non-linear composites of a set of t (t<n) underlying or LATENT VARIABLES in such a way as to retain as much of the original information as possible. The composites themselves might be chosen to obey other conditions, such as being mutually uncorrelated.

FIND BASIC DIMENSIONS, SO THAT THESE BASIC DIMENSIONS ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVABLE DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES.

4) Inter-object similarity

- the profile of each object (observation)
- develop a measure of inter-object similarity with respect to patterns in the recorded n variables

We could cluster individual objects into similar groups on the basis of the overall similarity of their profiles. INFORMATION ON SPECIFIC VARIABLES IS LOST IN THE COMPUTATION OF INTERINDIVIDUAL SIMILARITY MEASURES!

____________________________________________________________________

To a large extent the study of multivariate techniques is the study of linear transformations (i.e. data matrices undergo linear transformations).


Multiple regression aside from being the most popular multivariate technique in applied research, provides a vehicle for subsequent discussion of all basi matrix operations and, in particular, the topics of determinants, matrix inversion, and matrix rank. These aspects of matrix algebra are essential in understanding the procedures for solving simultaneous equations, as appearing in multiple regression and other multivariate procedures.

Ch. 2 - Vector and Matrix Operations for Multivariate Analysis

- vectors are ordered n-tuples of numbers that are subject to certain manipulative rules

- discuss the mean-corrected sums of squares and cross product (SSCP) matrices, covariance matrices and correlation matrices which are of particular interest to multivariate analysis; it shows the implementation details of the statistical matrices, making the implementation in Scala easier to imagine.
- check the hand-written notes  


See Paul Dawkins (2005) for more details on vectors and matrices and Quinn and Keough (2002) for statistical matrices.
