Using Linux as a Development Platform for Scala Projects

1. Introduction

In order to implement software development projects, one should consider which tools to choose for the different components of the development system - which are according to Rehman and Paul (2003): the hardware platform, the operating system, editors, compilers and assemblers, debuggers, version control system and bug tracking (Tesileanu 2017). For implementing Scala projects, working with the Simple Build Tool (SBT) (http://www.scala-sbt.org) condenses the list of the components of a development system, as it unites different steps in on tool (compiling, building, testing and debugging) (see Suereth and Farwell, 2016). Another advantage of using SBT is the opportunity of working interactively in Scala REPL, a tool for evaluating expressions in Scala (https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html), within a SBT session.  

It is also important to understand that the software development process "is not just writing code", but rather a more comprehensive process (Rehman and Paul, 2003).
