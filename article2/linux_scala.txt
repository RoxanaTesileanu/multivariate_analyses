Using Linux as a Development Platform for Scala Projects

1. Introduction

In order to implement software development projects, one should consider which tools to choose for the different components of the development system - which are according to Rehman and Paul (2003): the hardware platform, the operating system, editors, compilers and assemblers, debuggers, version control system and bug tracking (Tesileanu 2017). For implementing Scala projects, working with the Simple Build Tool (SBT) (http://www.scala-sbt.org) condenses the list of the components of a development system, as it unites different steps in on tool (compiling, building, testing and debugging) (Suereth and Farwell, 2016).
