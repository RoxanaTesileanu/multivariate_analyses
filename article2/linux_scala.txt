1. Introduction

In order to implement software development projects, one should consider which tools to choose for the different components of the development system - which are according to Rehman and Paul (2003): the hardware platform, the operating system, editors, compilers and assemblers, debuggers, version control system and bug tracking (Tesileanu 2017).
