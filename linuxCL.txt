Reference: The Linux Command Line, William E. Shotts, Jr., 2009

Using Vim

- vim starts in command mode
- change to insert mode with the i key
- to exit insert mode and return to command mode, press the Esc key
- save your changes with ":"
- to write the file to the hard drive we use ":w"
- move the cursor with "l" (right arrow), "h" (left arrow), "j" down one line, "k" up one line, "0" (to the beginning of the current line", "^" (first non-white space of the line), "$" (the end of the current line, "Ctrl-f" (page down), "Ctrl-b" (page up), "numberG" (to line number, ex: 1G), "G" the last line of the file

- appending text: move the cursor to the end of the line and type "a". This will append text at the end of that line. Or use "A" to move to the end of the line and start appending.
- you can use "o" to insert a line below the current line; and "O" to inser a line above the current line

- undo changes by using "u"

- deleting text: "x" will delete the current character; "3x" will delete the current and the next two characters
- "dd" deletes the current line, "5dd" deletes the current line and the next 4 lines
