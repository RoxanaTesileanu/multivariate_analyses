Principal components analysis (PCA)

The components are extracted either by spectral decomposition or singular value decomposition depending on the matrix used. 
We will have a z score for kth component for the ith object. There will be p components, but the first few summarize in general the most of the variation in the original variables. 

Don't forget to do an analysis of residuals if you retain less than p components (which variables contribute to large Q-values)?
You can use scaling/ordination plots to present the results.
