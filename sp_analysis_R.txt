Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R
Bivand, Pebesma, Gomez-Rubio 2008


Handling spatial data in R

- the sp package: classes and methods that look like GIS data models (to GIS people) and also behave like data frames (to applied statisticians)
- spatial data analysis is concerned with questions not directly answered by looking at the data themselves. Statistical inference reveals the processes that generate the observed data. 
- sp package: classes and methods for POINTS, LINES, POLYGONS, and GRIDS.
- for special tasks it might be efficient to combine R with Python to create a more efficient workflow.
