Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R

ch. 1: Introducing spatial data

Handling spatial data in R:

- the sp package: classes and methods that look like GIS data models (to GIS people) and also behave like data frames (to applied statisticians)
- spatial data analysis is concerned with questions not directly answered by looking at the data themselves. Statistical inference reveals the processes that generate the observed data. 
- sp package: classes and methods for POINTS, LINES, POLYGONS, and GRIDS.
- for special tasks it might be efficient to combine R with Python to create a more efficient workflow. 

Types of spatial data:
- spatial data have spatial reference (coord. values and a system of reference for those values). One of the most frequently used combinations is: pairs of longitude/latitude decimal degree values combined with the WGS84 (World Geodetic System 84) representation of the Earth.
- if spatial data include additional information like e.g. time, then time is called an attribute. Attributes are non-spatial information but are believed to exist for each spatial entity.
- the purely spatial information of entities is represented by spatial data models: point, line, polygon, grid.
Point: a single point location (GPS reading or geocoded address). VECTOR DATA MODEL
Line: a set of ordered points, connected by straight line segments. VECTOR DATA MODEL
Polygon: an area, marked by one or more enclosing lines, possibly containing holes. VECTOR DATA MODEL
Grid: a collection of points or rectangular cells, organised in a regular lattice. RASTER DATA MODEL

Vector data models represent entities as exactly as possible. A raster data model represents continuous surfaces. 

The rPython package calls Python in R. Usage from RBloggers https://www.r-bloggers.com/calling-python-from-r-with-rpython/:

library(rPython)
 
# Load/run the main Python script
python.load("myscript.py")
# Getting the variable
new_subs_data <- python.get("new_subs")
head(new_subs_data)

The gstat package provides a wide range of functions for univariate and multivariate geostatistics.
The geoR and geoRglm contain functions for model-based geostatistics.
The spBayes fits Gaussian univariate and multivariate models with MCMC.
The spTimer (also Bayesian), spatially predict and temporarily forcast large amounts of space-time data.
....and many more in the CRAN task view Analysis of Spatial Data.
