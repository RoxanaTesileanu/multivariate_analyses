Dissimilarity measures between objects for continuous variables

1. Euclidean
- the distance between two objects in multidimensional space
- the square root of the sum over all variables, of the square of the difference between the values of each variable for the two objects
- it is 0 for two objects with exaclty the same valures for all variables; otherwise has no upper limit and can be computed even if the objects have no variable in common at all

2. City block or Manhattan 
- the sum (across variables) of the absolute differences in the value of each variable between two objects
- will be dominated by variables with large values 

3. Minkowski
- in addition to Euclidean and City block, this measure normalizes both measures by dividing by the sample size, i.e. the no. of variables that contribute to the disctance measure
- for data sets with different no. of variables
