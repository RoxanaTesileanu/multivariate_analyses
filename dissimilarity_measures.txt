Dissimilarity measures between objects for continuous variables

1. Euclidean
- the distance between two objects in multidimensional space
- the square root of the sum over all variables, of the square of the difference between the values of each variable for the two objects
- it is 0 for two objects with exaclty the same valures for all variables; otherwise has no upper limit and can be computed even if the objects have no variable in common at all
