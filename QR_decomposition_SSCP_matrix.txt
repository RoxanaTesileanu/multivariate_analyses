The QR decomposition of a raw data matrix Y (singular value decomposition)

Notation:

Y - the raw data matrix
Z - matrix of eigenvectors of YY' 
YY' - covariance matrix between objects
U - matrix of eigenvectors of Y'Y
Y'Y - covariance matrix between variables
L - contains the eigenvalues (Î»I)


The SVD of Y is:

Y = ZL^1/2U'
