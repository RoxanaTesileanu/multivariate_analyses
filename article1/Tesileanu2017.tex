\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

Statistical computing in ecology evolves at a high speed, mainly because researchers have recognized the advantage of being able to design their algorithms according to their needs. The present paper introduces the implementation in Scala of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier based on Euclidean distances, which can be applied also on small datasets, a situation commonly encountered in ecological research.
