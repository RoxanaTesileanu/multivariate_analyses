Using plotly in Scala

Add the dependency to the SBT file:
"co.theasi" %% "plotly" % "0.2.0"

Then open REPL and type the commands for the first plotly plot:

import co.theasi.plotly._
val xs = (0.0 to 2.0 by 0.1)
val ys = xs.map(x => x*x)
val plot = Plot().withScatter(xs, ys)
draw(plot, "my-first-plot")
